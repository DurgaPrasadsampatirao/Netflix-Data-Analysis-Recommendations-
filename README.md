In this project aimed at enhancing Netflix's recommendation system, we embark on a thorough data preprocessing journey. Beginning with data cleaning, we meticulously rectify inconsistencies, handle missing values, and eliminate duplicates across columns such as 'title', 'director', 'cast', 'country', and 'description'. Subsequently, filtering procedures are applied to ensure the dataset's relevance, with criteria tailored to columns like 'type', 'release_year', and 'rating'. Following this, we delve into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where we unearth patterns and correlations within categorical variables such as 'listed_in' and numerical variables like 'duration' and 'release_year'. Armed with these insights, we proceed to enhance the recommendation system. Leveraging content-based filtering, we analyze 'listed_in', 'director', and 'cast' to suggest shows and movies akin to users' preferences. Collaborative filtering, meanwhile, utilizes user interactions, facilitated by 'show_id', 'rating', and 'date_added', to recommend content favored by similar users. Our approach may incorporate hybrid models, combining these strategies for optimal accuracy. Throughout, feature engineering plays a pivotal role. We may create new features based on 'cast' combinations or 'release_year' clusters to better capture user preferences and content characteristics. Rigorous model evaluation, utilizing metrics such as precision and recall, ensures the system's effectiveness. Following development, thorough implementation and testing validate the system's performance, often through A/B testing or user studies. Continuous monitoring and maintenance are integral, facilitating adaptation to evolving user behavior and content catalog updates. Ultimately, this project aims to optimize Netflix's recommendation system, delivering personalized and engaging content suggestions tailored to individual preferences.
